ReactiveSearch components can also be styled using inline-styles. Each component supports a `style` prop which accepts an object. Find more info on the [react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style).

> Note
>
> Using the `style` attribute as the primary means of styling elements is generally [not recommended](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style). ReactiveSearch components also support `className` prop allowing you to style them using CSS classes.

## Usage

You can pass the style object via the `style` prop like:

```js
{
    backgroundColor: 'coral',
    color: 'black'
}
```

Alternatively, you can also add a `className` to any component which gets applied to the component at the root level. You may also inject `className` to the inner levels using the `innerClass` prop. You can read more about it in the [next section](/theming/class.html).

## Examples

### Using the style prop

```js{3-6}
<DataSearch
    ...
    style={{
        border: '1px dashed coral',
        backgroundColor: '#fefefe'
    }}
/>
```

### Using the className prop

```js{3}
<DataSearch
    ...
    className="search-box"
/>
```
